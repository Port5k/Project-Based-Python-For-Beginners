# 10-1. Learning Python: Open a blank file in your text editor and write a few
# lines summarizing what youâ€™ve learned about Python so far. Start each line
# with the phrase In Python you can. . . . Save the file as learning_python.txt in
# the same directory as your exercises from this chapter. Write a program that
# reads the file and prints what you wrote three times. Print the contents once by
# reading in the entire file, once by looping over the file object, and once by storing the lines in a list and then working with them outside the with block.
